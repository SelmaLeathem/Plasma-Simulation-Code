# Plasma-Simulation-Code

A bounded one-dimensional plasma simulation, written in C++, that is capable of modelling a variety of plasma devices including radio-frequency gas discharges, the Tokamak divertor, and steady-state sheaths. A kinetic particle-in-cell code with Monte-Carlo collisions and secondary electrons, this code is capable of accounting for any type and number of species. Users can supply functions or constants that return the collision cross-sections and secondary electron yields. Sample Argon and atomic Hydrogen functions are supplied. For further details see "readme.docx". All source material is fully documented in the code.
