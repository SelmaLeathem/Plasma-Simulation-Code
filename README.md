# Plasma-Simulation-Code

This is a bounded one-dimensional kinetic particle-in-cell code with Monte-Carlo collisions and secondary electrons that is capable of accounting for any type of species, as well as any number of different types. Users can supply functions or constants that return the collision cross-sections and secondary electron yields. Sample Argon and atomic Hydrogen functions are supplied. For further details see "readme.docx".
